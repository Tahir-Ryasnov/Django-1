			What a wonderful phrase<br>
			Hakuna Matata!<br>
			Ain't no passing craze<br>
			<br>
			It means no worries<br>
			For the rest of your days<br>
			It's our problem-free philosophy<br>
			Hakuna Matata!<br>
			<br>
			When he was a young warthog<br>
			When I was a young warthog<br>
			He found his aroma lacked a certain appeal<br>
			He could clear the savannah after ev'ry meal<br>
			I'm a sensitive soul though I seem thick-skinned<br>
			And it hurt that my friends never stood downwind<br>
			<br>
			And, oh, the shame<br>
			Thought-a changin' my name<br>
			And I got downhearted<br>
			Everytime that I...<br>
			Hey, not in front of the Kids<br>
			Oh, sorry.<br>
			Hakuna Matata!<br>
			What a wonderful phrase<br>
			Hakuna Matata!<br>
			Ain't no passing craze<br>
			<br>
			It means no worries<br>
			For the rest of your days<br>
			It's our problem-free philosophy<br>
			<br>
			Hakuna Matata!<br>
			<br>
			Hakuna...it means no worries<br>
			For the rest of your days<br>
			It's our problem-free philosophy </p>
